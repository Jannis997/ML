1. What is the fundamental idea behind Support Vector Machines?
2. What is a support vector?
3. Why is it important to scale the inputs when using SVMs?
4. Can an SVM classifier output a confidence score when it classifies an instance?
What about a probability?
5. Should you use the primal or the dual form of the SVM problem to train a model
on a training set with millions of instances and hundreds of features?
6. Say you trained an SVM classifier with an RBF kernel. It seems to underfit the
training set: should you increase or decrease Î³ (gamma)? What about C?
