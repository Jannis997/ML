1. What is the fundamental idea behind Support Vector Machines?
2. What is a support vector?
3. Why is it important to scale the inputs when using SVMs?
4. Can an SVM classifier output a confidence score when it classifies an instance?
What about a probability?
5. Should you use the primal or the dual form of the SVM problem to train a model
on a training set with millions of instances and hundreds of features?
6. Say you trained an SVM classifier with an RBF kernel. It seems to underfit the
training set: should you increase or decrease Î³ (gamma)? What about C?

1. Fitting a street in the data where the middle line splits the classes. A certain number
  of instances can lie on the street. The width of the street is maximized
2. support vectors are the instances on the street, they influence the street. 
  Other instances outside the street do not influence the model at all.
3. Otherwise small features have less influence on the street than huge ones.
4. No probability but the distance between the border line and the instance can 
  be used as a confidence score
5. primal, dual is sensitive to the number in instances regarding the computation complexity
6. Increase gamma and C to increase the model complexity
